Download Option: Each generated image comes with a download button, allowing users to save their creations directly to their devices.
Responsive Design: The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Technology Stack


Frontend:
HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for interactivity and API integration


Backend:
OpenAI API for image generation


Implementation Steps :
1) Setting Up the Environment
Create an HTML file (index.html) for the main structure of the website.
Link CSS (style.css) for styling elements and JavaScript (index.js) for functionality.
2)HTML Structure
Design a simple layout that includes an input field for prompts, a dropdown for selecting the number of images, and a button to generate images.
Include a section to display generated images with download buttons.
3) Styling with CSS
Use CSS to style the webpage layout, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
Implement responsive design principles using media queries.
4) JavaScript Functionality
Write JavaScript code to handle form submissions, fetch data from the OpenAI API using fetch or axios, and display generated images on the page.
Implement error handling for cases where image generation fails or when no input is provided.
5) Integrating OpenAI API
Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set up authentication in your JavaScript code.
Create functions to send requests to the OpenAI API with user prompts and retrieve generated images.
6) Download Functionality
Implement functionality that allows users to download generated images by creating links that point to the image URLs returned by the API.
